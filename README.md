# Description

This is a base for intense routing applications. Use this in your projects that need a strong, well written, secure and simple HTTP server with a optional debugger. This has a very weird setup as well but it is still handy.

# Setup 

* Make sure crystal is installed 

* Make sure the following is installed `sudo apt-get install gcc pkg-config git tzdata \
                           libpcre3-dev libevent-dev libyaml-dev \
                           libgmp-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev`

* Make sure you include the crystal file and start routing 

# Usage.

Take the SRC directory and Settings directory and place it into the desired project location. Then create your main crystal file or embed the crystal functions near or around that current set directory. An example is the following tree

```
├── example_File_Input
│   └── example.html
├── router.cr
├── Settings
│   ├── Router.json
│   └── Server.json
└── src
    ├── Server.cr
    ├── Server_Debug.cr
    ├── Server_FINF.cr
    ├── Server_Json.cr
    ├── Server_Responder.cr
    ├── Server_Router.cr
    └── Template.cr
```

where router.cr in other terms `main.cr` would look like this 

```crystal
